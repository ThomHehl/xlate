# xlate
## Tool for Bible translation

I created xlate to assist me in translating the Bible into English. It probably has other purposes, but I'm going to let others assist with that.

The point of the tool is to have a main editor window that shows the current translation text with links to the source
words and access to notes and other items around that word.

For the time, I'm only doing right to left, so I interpolate the Hebrew backwards because it serves my purpose.

If you wish to assist, just ask.
